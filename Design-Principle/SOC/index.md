# Separation of Concerns (SoC) Principle

## üß© 1. What is the Separation of Concerns (SoC) Principle?

### Definition:

Separation of Concerns means dividing a program into distinct sections, where each section handles a specific responsibility or concern ‚Äî and nothing else.

A concern is simply a particular feature, functionality, or behavior of a program.

Each module/class/function should focus on one job, not mix multiple responsibilities.

## üí° 2. Why We Need to Use It

### ‚úÖ Benefits:

* **Maintainability**: You can change one part of the code without breaking others.
* **Reusability**: Components that do one thing well are easier to reuse elsewhere.
* **Testability**: Small, focused units are simpler to test.
* **Scalability**: You can extend features without touching unrelated code.
* **Collaboration**: Teams can work on separate modules in parallel.

### ‚ùå Without SoC:
You get "spaghetti code" ‚Äî hard to understand, hard to test, hard to change.

## üè† 3. Real-World Analogy

Think of a restaurant kitchen üçΩÔ∏è

* The chef cooks food
* The waiter serves food
* The cashier handles billing

If the waiter starts cooking and the chef handles payments ‚Äî the system breaks down.

Each role (concern) must stay separate but collaborate through clear interfaces.

That's Separation of Concerns.

## üíª 4. Code Example (Before vs After)

### ‚ùå Before (Violates SoC)

```typescript
class UserService {
  createUser(name: string, email: string) {
    // Business logic
    const user = { name, email };

    // Database logic
    console.log("Saving user to database:", user);

    // Notification logic
    console.log("Sending welcome email to:", email);
  }
}
```

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Problem:
One class handles user creation, database operations, and notifications ‚Äî three separate concerns.

### ‚úÖ After (Follows SoC)

```typescript
class UserRepository {
  save(user: any) {
    console.log("Saving user to database:", user);
  }
}

class EmailService {
  sendWelcomeEmail(email: string) {
    console.log("Sending welcome email to:", email);
  }
}

class UserService {
  private repo: UserRepository;
  private emailService: EmailService;

  constructor(repo: UserRepository, emailService: EmailService) {
    this.repo = repo;
    this.emailService = emailService;
  }

  createUser(name: string, email: string) {
    const user = { name, email };
    this.repo.save(user);
    this.emailService.sendWelcomeEmail(email);
  }
}
```

### Usage:

```typescript
const userService = new UserService(new UserRepository(), new EmailService());
userService.createUser("Alice", "alice@example.com");
```

#### ‚û°Ô∏è Now:

* **UserRepository** ‚Üí only handles data persistence
* **EmailService** ‚Üí only handles communication
* **UserService** ‚Üí only coordinates logic

You can modify or test each part independently.

## üß† 5. Conclusion

| Aspect | Without SoC | With SoC |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Code organization | Mixed, messy | Clear, modular |
| Maintenance | Hard | Easy |
| Reusability | Low | High |
| Testing | Complex | Simple |

Separation of Concerns is about clarity and control.

Each part of your system does one thing well, and together they build a robust application.
